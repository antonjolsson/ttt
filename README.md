# TTT - Tic-Tac-Toe with naive AI implementation
Small Tic-Tac-Toe implementation which allows single and multiplayer mode. For single-player, the "hard" difficulty  level is implemented without any previous knowledge of AI algorithms, using a naive recursion-based solution with outcome points weighted by the squared inverse of their recursion depth.
