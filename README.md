# TTT - tic-tac-toe with naive AI implementation
Small tic-tac-toe implementation which allows single and multiplayer mode. For single-player, the "hard" difficulty  level is implemented without any previous knowledge of AI algorithms, using a naive recursion-based solution with "outcome points" weighted by the recursion depth.
